//CONVENTIONS FOR VARIABLE NAMES
//camelCase yo.
//cannot start a variable name w/ a number: 3years
//cannot contain ampersand... 
//acceptable: letters, numbers, underscores, dollar sign
//variables cannot be named using a reserved js keyword, such as 'new', 'function'
//do not start variable name with an Uppercase Letter, this is reserved for object-oriented programming
//true constant can be all uppercase, e.g. PI = 3.1415
//use descriptive variable names, 'myFirstJob' is better than 'job1'
